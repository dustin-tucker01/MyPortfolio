| Project Link      | Tools Used | Project Description | 
|---    |   ---|---|
| [Churn Analysis](https://github.com/dustin-tucker01/ChurnAnalysis)                  | SQL | I used complex SQL queries to explore telecom data to answer business questions relating to churn. I then provided recommendations based on my findings to provide data-driven actionable tasks that the business can do to reduce churn. This project demonstrates my SQL query writing ability as well as my problem-solving ability. |
| [Learning SQL](https://github.com/dustin-tucker01/LearningSQL)                       | SQL | After learning basic SQL syntax, I began tackling solving problems using SQL, and this respository serves the purpose of showcasing the problems I have solved in my learning. |
